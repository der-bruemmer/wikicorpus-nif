NIF Wikipedia corpus
==============

Compiling a wikipedia corpus in the NLP Interchange Format.

The final corpus will contain Wikipedia abstracts as well as annotated links within these abstracts. Links to the LOD wikilinks corpus will also be provided.

Usage
==============

The implementation provided needs the long extracted abstracts from the DBpedia extraction framework in .nt format. 

The modified DBpediaFunctionns.php has to be used before the extraction to be able to extract the links.


The final corpus is too large (over 20gb) to be hosted here and will soon be published.
